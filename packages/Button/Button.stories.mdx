# Buttons

Buttons are used to interact with the user. To make this possible,
the user must first understand that the button can be actively used.
To do this, it should stand out from the environment, e.g. through color.
In addition, the user should be told succinctly what to do with the button.
Therefore, the button must always be provided with an icon or word that
explains the function of this button to the user. A combination of icon and
text is often suitable.
The basic element of the button is `<Button>...</Button>`.

## Filled Button

Filled buttons are identified by their color fill. The fill color in the
normal state is `primaryColor`, in hover or active state `primaryColorAccent1`
and in the focus state `primaryColorAccent2`. This color fill makes this button type
type look very distinctive and slightly eye-catching. This is the normal state of the
button, so it is not necessary to add an attribute. However, if you still want to
want to add an attribute, it is `filled`. Also, they cannot be combined with the
`outlined` attribute, because they belong to the _main button types_.

<Story name="Filled" default>
  <Button contained>Button</Button>
</Story>

`<Button>Button</Button>` or `<Button contained>Button</Button>`

## Outlined Button

Outlined buttons belong to the _main button types_ and cannot be combined with the
`contained` attribute. They have a colored border and an icon or text field. Their background
is normally transparent, in hover or active state it changes to the 90% transparent
variable `primaryColor` and in focus state to the 70% transparent variable `primaryColor`.
Thus this button type is much more inconspicuous than the [Contained Button](#contained-button). To
create this button you need the attribute `outlined`.

<Story name="Outlined">
  <Button outlined>Button</Button>
</Story>

`<Button outlined>Button</Button>`

## Icon Button

Icon buttons belong to the _additional button types_ and can get either the `contained` or `outlined`
attribute. If they get the `contained` attribute or neither, they apply the style of the
[Contained Button](#contained-button), if they get the `outlined` attribute, they apply the style of the
[Outlined Button](#outlined-button). Regardless of this, they identify themselves by at least one icon as
a label. Often these buttons contain another text label to make the function of the button even clearer.
Otherwise, the [Floating Action Button](#floating-action-button) is recommended.

<Story name="Icon">
  <Button>
    <Plus size="18" /> Button
  </Button>
</Story>

`<Button> <Plus size="18" /> Button </Button>` or `<Button outlined> <Plus size="18" /> Button </Button>`

\* The component `<Plus />` is a [Heroku icon](https://github.com/impulse/heroicons-react)

## Rounded Button

Rounded buttons are _additional button types_, so they can be given the attributes
`contained` or `outlined` and change accordingly [see Icon Button](#icon-button). They are
characterized only by their completely rounded edges.

<Story name="Rounded">
  <Button rounded>Button</Button>
</Story>

`<Button rounded>Button</Button>`

## Floating Action Button

Floating Actions Buttons also belong to the _additional Button types_ [see Icon Button](#icon-button).
Therefore they can also get the attributes `contained` or `outlined` and apply the corresponding
design. Floating Action Buttons are also abbreviated FAB and have a circular design. Thus,
only one icon is suitable as a label. The corresponding attribute for this button is `fab`.

<Story name="FAB">
  <Button fab>
    <Plus />
  </Button>
</Story>
